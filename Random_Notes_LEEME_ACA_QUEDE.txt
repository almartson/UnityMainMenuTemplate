1-	UNITY MENU 

	.1-		Best Practices.
	
		* 	Coroutine: LOADING SLIDER BAR.	---listo!
		->
		I can optimize Coroutines, with the same Methodollogy applied in my Script  'LeftRightTest.cs', from my previous Project.
		->
		WaitFor...: MUST be Cached at the Start or Awake Method.
		->
		To cache in a Start or Awake Method:   StartCoroutine( IENumeratorMio )
		->
		To Cache 'IENumeratorMio' (thus making it reusable, by means of: StopCoroutine() y StartCoroutine(), in OnEnable() and OnDisable()... ).
		->
		yield return null; // It is already optimum: it waits until the END of the NEXT FRAME

2-  IMPORTANT:  It features TEXTMESHPRO, but the PREFORMANCE CAN BE BETTER  (HOW?):

Recommendations:


    .1- REPLACE all STATIC TEXT (e.g.: Static LABELS) by:  Image (a Texture or Sprite ade in Photoshop [using 'Bicubic for optimal Reduction in size' for Rendering]). 

    In Unity3D:   Use my CUSTOM UI MATERIAL, to make use of Static and Dynamic BATCHING).


    .2- Only use TEXTMESHPRO TEXT Box in cases where you need DYNAMIC-CHANGING Text (for instance: in the Loading % Number - Progress Bar).


    .3- Changing TEXTMESHPRO's Shader from ''SDF-Mobile-distance field'' to -> ''SDF-Mobile-Bitmap''  could serve as an Optimization, but You Shoul read how to MAKE AN HIGH QUALITY FONT ATLAS, because I tested the one that comes by 'default' for ARIAL FONT: and it Looked Blurry and did not pass the text.

# UnityMainMenuTemplate

### A Template of the most basic Main Menu Structure for any Game in Unity3D. 

It is based in the 'starting from an Empty Scene with some DontDestroyOn(Un)load GameObjects', with important Scripts, such as: GameManager.cs, and common (to all scenes) Components such as: MainCamera, AudioSource (i.e.: Background Music).

I made the Menus based on this Official Unity Tutorial:

## Notes:

* Also I am sharing in the Assets Folder some good Debugging Tools I customized for my needs (you can make good use of them, according to the M.I.T.'s Licence statements). The Folder's path and name are: 'Assets/_DebugToolsAlMartson'

* In the path 'Assets/UnityMenu' I included a great Unity Offcial Asset: <strong>Unity Samples: UI </strong> (https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/essentials/unity-samples-ui-25468)

Have fun!

# UnityMainMenuTemplate

A Template of the most basic Main Menu Structure for any Game in Unity3D. 

It is based in the 'starting from an Empty Scene with some DontDestroyOn(Un)load GameObjects', with important Scripts, such as: GameManager.cs, and common (to all scenes) Components such as: MainCamera, AudioSource (i.e.: Background Music).

I made the Menus based on this Official Unity Tutorial:
